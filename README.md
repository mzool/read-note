# **Growth mindset**
### It is that you believe that you can achieve and getting better with hard working and love of your work. If you want to achieve that, you have to face your problems, learning from your mistakes, and keep trying till you are proud. for me, what I do? the answer is that start in my head, I have to be positive what ever happened, I face my problems not running awy, I keep trying when I fall down and I lear from my mistake.
