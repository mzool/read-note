# Comparisons operators that give boolean results:
+ ## == equal to.
+ ## !== not equal to.
+ ## === strict equal to.
+ ### !=== strict not equal to.
+ ## > greater
+ ## < less than
+ ## >= greater than or equal
+ ## <= less than or equal
# Comparison can be between two operands or between two operators.
# Logical operators allow us to compare the results of comparison operators:
## "&&" logical and: to give true both of the expressions should be true if any one false then it give false.
+ ## "||" logical or: it give always true exept when the both expressions give false then it give false.
+ ## "!" not: it take a single boolean value and convert it to the opposite value. \
# If statement: chech the condition inside and if it gives true the subsequent code block work.
# (If else) statement give a two side of code, if "if" condition is false then "else" condition will run.
# While statement does the thing as long as the condition is true.
# Loops: loops check condition, if it return true, then the code block will run.
# For loop: using for loops when the
