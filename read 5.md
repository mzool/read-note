##  A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
## Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.
## Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
## CSS declarations sit in curly braces and hava a two parts: 
## properties: that spicify the type of the features.
## Value: the sitting of the features.
## Why to using CSS seperate sheet?
## To make all of the html pages share the same style then use one seperate CSS sheet, and if you want to edite some features then it is easy to do that from the CSS sheet.
## Sometimes if you have one html page  put CSS code inside it or if you want to change a part of html page without the other parts then you can add CSS inside html directly.
## So you can use CSS:  inside the html elements, external "separate sheet" and internal "by using block <style>....</style>.
