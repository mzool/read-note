# A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step by step.
# To write a script:
+ ## Define your goal.
+ ## Draw a picture or a map or flowchart.
+ ## Start coding.
# Any exprission results to just one value, and there are two types of exprissions:
+ ## Exprission that assign a value to a variable.
+ ## Exprission that use more than one value wich result one final value to save inside the variable.
# Operators: Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. For example ARITHMETIC OPERATORS (var z = number * number).
# Functions: Function is a group of statements that do a spicific task.
# When using finction not every statement in that function will be perform, for example yes/no questions user chose yes or no then the computer run the user choice but do not perform the both.
# The result of function is known as return value.
# Declaring function: give it a name and write statement inside curly braces, if it need a parameter to work then put that parameter inside it and parameters will treat as variables.
# Calling function: after declaring a function call it by typing (function name;), when calling a function with parameters put the parameters value directly after the function's name (function name (1.3);).
