# Computer Processes: its the same processes from the first computer till now.
+ ## Take informations "Inputs", from different recources like mouse, keyboard ..... etc . 
+ ## Storing and processing, computers take information to the memory then send it to processer "CPU" to processe it and finally to memory again .
+ ## Give outputs, , so output devices can transform binary sequence to a phisical motion maybe or can be photos, videos, texts... etc .
# computers consist from several electrical circuits that have a many electrical wires, so each wire can represent a two value of data, 0 or 1, depending on the electricity currint that pass's  through, and when computer consist from many wires so there are a milions of outputs can made from combine circuits, them computers deal with just 0 and 1, from this computers represent any inputs that take as groub of 0 and 1, and this called the binary system.Any type of data could represented by binary system, numbers represented by sequence of 0 and 1, every letter have a number in binary system, and each number have a sequence of 0 and 1.For images and videos, every image consist of a small frictions that called pixels, every pixel colored with one color, and every color have a binary sequence.Sounds make a vibrations in the air, and vibrations could represented by waveform, waveform could represented by numbers.
# Inorder to modify and combine inputs data; computers need a part make it do that, for that a million of circuits are work toghether to modify the inputs buy using millions of tiny wires give on or off, true or false, it just have two values.Circuits have many types inorder to do what mentioned, adder circuit sum the inputes together and give a one output, and circuit give 1 if any of the two input is 1.Combining circuit together with different type make computer processe a million of operations.Older the circuits was larger so computers take a much time to solve a simple calculation, now the smaller circuits ara much faster because the distance of wire is so short and electricity velocity equals to light velocity.
# HARDWARE and SOFTWARE:
## all the parts that we can deal with, touch it and see it are the hardware, but the software is the codes,programs, that inside computers we can't thouch it but we can manage, edite, show, hear .... using hardwares. We use CPU to manage the all parts of computer, it tells the parts what to do,
